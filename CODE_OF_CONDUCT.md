# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be decent to each other. This is a hobby project, not a corporation—we don't need pages of legalese.

## The Slightly Longer Version

Everyone who participates in this project—whether by opening issues, submitting PRs, or commenting—is expected to:

- **Be respectful.** Disagree constructively. Critique code, not people.
- **Be patient.** This is maintained in spare time. Responses might take a few days.
- **Be helpful.** If you see someone struggling, lend a hand if you can.
- **Stay on topic.** Keep discussions relevant to the project.

Don't:
- Harass, insult, or demean others
- Post spam or promotional content
- Derail discussions with unrelated topics
- Be a jerk

## Enforcement

If someone is being disruptive, they'll be asked to stop. Repeat offenders or severe violations will result in being blocked from the project.

This isn't complicated—just be a reasonable person.
